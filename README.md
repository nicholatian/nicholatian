# Welcome to the machine.

This is my GitHub profile.

I am a theoretical informatician and amateur software engineer from the
[Research Triangle][Research Triangle]. What code I write is scarce but
immaculate, and I have a lot more important contributions to share in
architecture instead. I discovered the notion of mechanicalism as an
approach to programming, in contrast to functionalism that dominated
the world before. I created [C*][C*] as a variant of ANSI C and the
first mechanicalist systems programming language.

I am the founder and president of [Xion Megatrends][Xion Megatrends], a
company I created as a vehicle for developing and marketing my personal
supercomputer project, _**Anodyne**._ I am also the sole proprietor of
[Aquefir Consulting][Aquefir Consulting], a consulting company and
personal portfolio. I am also the co-founder of [Arqadium][Arqadium],
a video game development and publishing studio, along with my husband.

Xion Megatrends is my main focus for the time being. I am putting
together a laboratory, which I will fill with research computers from
the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s. These PCs will help me create the
[Byblos SDK][Byblos SDK], which I will then use to
develop [Sirius DOS][Sirius DOS], the
[Feeble C compiler][Feeble C compiler], [Sirius C*][Sirius C*],
[Hinterlib][Hinterlib], [Oraci&oacute;n][Oracion], [Quindle][Quindle],
and more.

[my sponsorship pitch](https://github.com/sponsors/nicholatian). There
are tiers friendly to all budgets and interest, and if you can&rsquo;t
throw in, it would still mean the world to me if you looked around,
starred some projects, or even opened up an issue. I need all the
encouragement I can get. Thank you!
