# Welcome to the machine.

This is my GitHub profile. For social media, GitHub is my second-favourite site to use, after [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a_nicholi) of course.

I am a computer scientist and researcher at heart. Naturally, I live and work from home in the [Research Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle). My most prized work is on well-behaved systems, which I have spent several years slowly building towards through research. I realised years ago that something was wrong with how people approached systems programming, and have always been aghast at the cynical culture that arose to cope with the inability of engineers to deal with the machine. To solve this, I wrote [several](https://nicholatian.com/ethos) [essays](https://nicholatian.com/lawandorder) exploring the issue, and resolved to create C\*, a programming language.

Besides the research work, I also have several projects in the works together, many of which are under the [Aquefir](https://aquefir.co/) banner. This includes [Neopolitan C](https://aquefir.co/neopolitan), the [Cave Of Origin](https://caveoforig.in/), the [Slick Makefiles](https://aquefir.co/adp4), [SLI documentation](https://aquefir.co/adp2), a [modular programming guide](https://aquefir.co/adp3), and the [Command Line Interface Guide](https://aquefir.co/adp6). I also made [a protocol](https://aquefir.co/adp1) for Git repository structure that has a palette canon for issue labels, and [a colour palette](https://aquefir.co/adp7) of various programming languages.

If you like what I do, please check out [my sponsorship pitch](https://github.com/sponsors/nicholatian). There are tiers friendly to all budgets and interest, and if you canâ€™t throw in, it would still mean the world to me if you looked around, starred some projects, or even opened up an issue. I need all the encouragement I can get. Thank you!
