# Welcome to the machine.

This is my GitHub profile. For social media, GitHub is my second-favourite site to use, after [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a_nicholi) of course.

I am a computer scientist and researcher at heart. Naturally, I live and work from home in the [Research Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle). My most prized work is on well-behaved systems, which I have spent several years slowly building towards through research. I realised years ago that something was wrong with how people approached systems programming, and have always been aghast at the cynical culture that arose to cope with the inability of engineers to deal with the machine. To solve this, I wrote [several](https://nicholatian.com/ethos) [essays](https://nicholatian.com/lawandorder) exploring the issue, and resolved to create C\*, a programming language. I also work on [Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) with [**Justine Tunney**](https://github.com/jart), something C\* will use one day.
